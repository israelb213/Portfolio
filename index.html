        <p id ="about">My name is Israel Beltran.  I write code and watch movies.  I'm learning full stack programming, interested in getting into front-end programming because of the creativity that it allows.  I enjoy working with other people to create better stuff then what I could have created on my own.  I have my degree in Film writing and production.  In my free time I enjoy watching movies, playing videogames, running and playing basketball. </p=>
        <p id ="about">My favorite movies are Amadeus, O Brother Where Art Thou and The Mask.  My favorite video games are Spyro and Resident Evil 2.</p>
